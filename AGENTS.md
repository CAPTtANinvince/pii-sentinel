## PII Sentinel

- Detection, file parsing, and redaction live in the Vercel Functions under `/api` (`api/scan.ts`, `api/redact.ts`, `api/health.ts`, shared code in `api/_lib`). Do not delete or move them. Never put provider keys, Lovable Cloud, databases, or auth in the frontend (`src/`); provider keys are server-side Vercel env vars only.
- Backend seam: all live calls go through `src/lib/pii-sentinel-api.ts` (POST `/api/scan`, POST `/api/redact`) with contract types in `src/lib/pii-sentinel-types.ts`; mock mode (`VITE_USE_MOCK_API` on by default) serves synthetic fixtures from `src/lib/mock-scan-data.ts` and must never be presented as analysis of user input.
- Design system is Swiss/editorial: SPICY red `#C62020`, QUALITY white, DEEP TASTE black `#141414`; Helvetica/Arial display, Georgia body, IBM Plex Mono technical — tokens defined in `src/styles.css`, never hardcoded in components.
